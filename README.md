*Attractive, easy on-brand pages for* Athens *using these templates.*

## Use

These templates are for the [Athens](https://github.com/AthensFramework/core) web framework. You must be using Athens to use these templates.

1. Add the Admissions theme templates to the package requirements in your `composer.json`:

  ```
  "require": {
        ...
        "athens/core": "0.*",
        "uwdoem/admissions": "0.*",
        ...
  },
  ```
  
  The major version number of `uwdoem/boundless` should be the same as your major version number of `athens/core`.

2. Add the Admissions and Boundless templates in your project's `setup.php`, **above** the line that adds your project-templates (order matters!):
  ```
  Settings::addTemplateDirectory(dirname(__FILE__) ."/vendor/uwdoem/admissions/templates");
  Settings::addTemplateDirectory(dirname(__FILE__) ."/vendor/uwdoem/boundless/templates");
  Settings::addTemplateDirectory(dirname(__FILE__) ."/project-templates");
  ```
